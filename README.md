## About the Project

This project is a task management application built using Vue.js for the frontend and a backend server to handle API requests. The application allows users to create, update, delete, and manage their tasks efficiently. It is designed to be user-friendly and responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across devices.

### Key Features
- **Task Management**: Add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
- **API Integration**: Communicates with a backend server for data persistence.
- **Customizable Backend URL**: Easily configure the backend URL in the `config/api.js` file.

### Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: Vue.js
- **Backend**: Any server capable of handling RESTful API requests (e.g., Node.js, Laravel, etc.)
- **Styling**: CSS frameworks or custom styles
